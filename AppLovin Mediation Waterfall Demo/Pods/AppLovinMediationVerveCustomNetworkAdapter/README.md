# Waterfall
Waterfall mediation is only supported via AppLovin MAX's custom network adapters.

## AppLovin SDK Integration
Please follow the official [AppLovin SDK Integration documentation](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/ios/getting-started/integration#integration). This step is identical to bidding setup.

We recommend that you also complete steps 2 and 3 for a complete AppLovin MAX SDK bidding setup. This will ensure that your app contains all components required to enable bidding in parallel to waterfall mediation without further app changes required.
